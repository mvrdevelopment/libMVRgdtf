# libMVRgdtf

**GDTF**: The `General Device Type Format` is an open standard for describing devices of the entertainment industry. These devices may be lighting fixtures, trusses, distribution boxes, media servers, lasers or other devices used in the entertainment industry. [This documentation](https://github.com/mvrdevelopment/spec/blob/main/gdtf-spec.md) describes [DIN SPEC 15800:2022-02](https://www.beuth.de/en/technical-rule/din-spec-15800/349717520) also known as GDTF, version 1.2.

**MVR**: The `My Virtual Rig` file format is an open standard which allows programs to share data and geometry of a scene for the entertainment industry. A scene is a set of parametric objects such as fixtures, trusses, video screens, and other objects that are used in the entertainment industry. [This documentation](https://github.com/mvrdevelopment/spec/blob/main/mvr-spec.md) describes [DIN SPEC 15801:2023-12](https://www.dinmedia.de/en/technical-rule/din-spec-15801/373968511) also known as MVR, version 1.6.



The GDTF file format is standardized in [DIN SPEC 15800:2022-02](https://www.beuth.de/en/technical-rule/din-spec-15800/349717520).

The MVR file format is standardized in [DIN SPEC 15801:2023-12](https://www.dinmedia.de/en/technical-rule/din-spec-15801/373968511).
