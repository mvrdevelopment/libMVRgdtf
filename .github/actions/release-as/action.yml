# WORK IN PROGRESS

# The idea was to have a main package that installs the other three packages as dependencies, maybe optionalDependencies, keeping the same version somehow.
# maybe a postinstall script that gets the current version of the main package and attempts to `npm install @mvr/lib-$OS@<main-version>`.

# This composite action Releases a different-named package with the same version as the main one
# Can modify any package.json params before releasing (name, os, files etc.)
# Checks out to a temporary branch, prepares the package and releases it directly (not following auto shipit defaults)

# Usage:
# - name: Release OS
#   uses: ./libMvrGdtf/.github/actions/release-as
#   env:
#     GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_PKG_KEY }}
#     NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.NPM_PKG_KEY}}
